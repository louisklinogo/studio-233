# Implementation Plan: Vortex Animation & Interaction Refinement (Kinetic Lock)

Refining the transition into a "Decryption Glyph" sequence, a "Kinetic Flip" handover, and a "Vertical Magazine" manifesto.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure & Glyph logic [checkpoint: 592ce00]
- [x] Task: Update `VortexHeroV2.tsx` to include `blackBoxRef`, `bracketsRef`, and the character cycling logic.
- [x] Task: Implement the "Decryption Glyph" method in `VortexHeroV2.tsx` to flicker through `[CANVAS]`, `[STUDIO]`, `[AGENTIC]`.
- [x] Task: Update `KineticTrack.tsx` to support vertical `flex-col` stacking and the `shutter-overlay` DOM structure.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Glyph Infrastructure' (Protocol in workflow.md) 592ce00

## Phase 2: The Rising Stage Handover [checkpoint: 7c7d8aa]
- [x] Task: Implement the "Rising Stage" reveal (Matte Black section slides up to cover Hero).
- [x] Task: Synchronize the "Success Flash" orange border micro-interaction.
- [x] Task: Implement the "Decryption Glyph" stable logic with GSAP proxy.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Rising Stage' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Typographic Monolith [checkpoint: d29acc8]
- [x] Task: Refactor Manifesto into a cinematic 3-row horizontal block.
- [x] Task: Implement the "Scanner Wave" staggered shutter reveal.
- [x] Task: Integrate "Technical Reference" indices and Braun-style corner notches.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Monolith' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Final Polish & Act Integration [checkpoint: 7c7d8aa]
- [x] Task: Perform full regression sweep of Act I -> II -> III. [5eb2145]
- [x] Task: Ensure scroll-back stability (no malformed states). [7c7d8aa]
- [x] Task: Verify 60fps performance across the entire transition. [7c7d8aa]
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Final Polish' (Protocol in workflow.md) [7c7d8aa]

## Phase 5: Substrate Reveal & Refinery [checkpoint: 956d6e3]
- [x] Task: Implement "Batch Asset Refinery" narrative in `ProductionEngine.tsx`.
- [x] Task: Implement "Substrate Reveal" transition (dissolving stage background).
- [x] Task: Refactor "Lockup" animation to "Upper-Left Corner" watermark style.
- [x] Task: Activate image states for "Creative" and "Process" during extraction.
