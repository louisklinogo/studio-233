You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs, often referred to as "AI slop" [3]. For this task, you MUST adhere strictly to the **International Typographic Style (Swiss Design)** principles [3] fused with **Dieter Rams' (Braun) Industrial Design ethos**. Make creative, distinctive frontends that emphasize clarity, functionality, and minimalism.

Focus on the following Swiss & Braun Design vectors:

*   **Typography:** Typography instantly signals quality [8]. Choose **neutral, objective sans-serif fonts** that prioritize clarity and readability. Avoid using generic fonts like Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, or default system fonts [3, 8]. **Emphasize high contrast pairings** (e.g., geometric sans-serif for headings, neutral sans-serif for body) [8]. Use size jumps and extreme weights (100/200 vs 800/900) to create clear hierarchy [8]. Load fonts from a clean source like Google Fonts [8].
*   **Color & Theme (Digital Industrial):** Commit to a **cohesive, minimalist aesthetic** [3]. The dominant palette must be **neutral, high-contrast** (e.g., off-whites, warm greys, matte blacks), mimicking physical materials like plastic, metal, and aluminum. Use color **only for function**:
    *   **Braun Orange (#FF4D00):** Use sparingly for primary actions or "power" elements.
    *   **Signal Green:** Use for active states.
    *   Avoid timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Use dominant neutrals with these sharp accents.
*   **Tactility & Interface:** Treat the UI as a **precision instrument**. Controls should feel physical and mechanical.
    *   Use **matte finishes** instead of glossy/glassy effects.
    *   Employ precise geometry (super-ellipses) and soft but exact radii.
    *   "Less but Better": Remove anything non-essential.
*   **Layout & Structure:** Prioritize a **strict grid system** and use **asymmetrical, functional layouts** [3]. The focus must be on **information hierarchy** and visual clarity, rather than decoration [9].
*   **Motion:** Use animations and micro-interactions **only when they serve a functional purpose** (like clarifying state or directing attention) [3]. Prioritize subtle, quick, CSS-only transitions over elaborate effects to maintain the design's cleanliness [3].
*   **Backgrounds:** **Default to vast white space** or light, neutral backgrounds to create atmosphere and depth [3]. Layer subtle, clean CSS gradients or geometric patterns only if they support the strict grid and minimalist theme; **never use atmospheric or textured backgrounds** (like parchment or leather-bound styling) that clash with the clean aesthetic [3, 9].

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:

*   Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts) [3]
*   Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds) [3]
*   Designs that lack context-specific character [3]
*   Shiny, "gumdrop" buttons or standard Bootstrap/Material styles.

Interpret creatively, but **always ensure that functional clarity and cleanliness override ornamentation**. You still tend to converge on common choices across generations. **Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box while strictly adhering to the principles of functional minimalism!** [10]
